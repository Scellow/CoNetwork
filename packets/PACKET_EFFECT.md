**MsgEffect:** This packet was never implemented, or cannot be discovered within our current mediums of research. It can be assumed that this packet was originally drafted to send an ANI effect to the client, or send a magic effect to the client. This was most likely never implemented in favor of either the [[MsgName]] packet (which can send ANI effects to the client) or the [[MsgMagicEffect]] packet (which sends magic attacks between the server and client).
