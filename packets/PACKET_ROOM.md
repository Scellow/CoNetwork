**MsgRoom:** This packet was never implemented, or cannot be discovered within our current mediums of research. It can be assumed that the packet was never implemented in favor of the [[MsgMapInfo]] packet, which defines map (and room) rules and identifiers. This packet may also had been originally drafted for displaying room information in the shell (now just built into the game client).
